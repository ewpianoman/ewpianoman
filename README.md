I'm a software engineer specializing in building intuitive, user-centered interfaces with React, React Native, and modern JavaScript. With a background in music education and a passion for the intersection of technology and the arts, I bring a unique perspective to software developmentâ€”understanding not just how to build great tools, but how people actually use them.

## ðŸŽµ The Music + Tech Connection

I've been teaching piano for 15+ years and understand firsthand how the right software can transform education and creative work. I'm especially interested in building tools for musicians, educators, and creative professionals.

I use music [MyMusicStaff](https://www.mymusicstaff.com/) to run my music studio, play regularly with a worship band, and hold a Master's degree in Music Technology from Indiana University Indianapolis.

## ðŸŒ± Background

Before software engineering, I:
- Built computer science programs at two high schools, growing enrollment by 480%
- Founded an award-winning FIRST Robotics team
- Worked in technical support, maintaining a 98% customer satisfaction rating
- Taught piano for 15+ years

This diverse background gives me a unique perspective on building software that actually serves people's needs.
